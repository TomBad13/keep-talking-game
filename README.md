# Bomb Game

## Overview
This game is a Bomb created in Python based on the Game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. Created using Tkinter, you can either use a Graphical Interface or just the Terminal. Have fun and if you need anything you can contact "tombad2" on Discord!

## Usage
To play the game, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py [MODE] [NUMBER OF WIRES]
```

Replace `[MODE]` with:
- `1` for Terminal mode
- `2` for Graphical Interface mode

Replace `[NUMBER OF WIRES]` with the desired number of wires for the bomb.

### Modes:
- **Terminal Mode (`1`):** Allows interaction with the game via the terminal/console.
- **Graphical Interface Mode (`2`):** Provides a graphical user interface for a more visual gaming experience.
